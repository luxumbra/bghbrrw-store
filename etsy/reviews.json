The overall effect, either with or without the little lights on is gorgeous. Thank you so much for prompt, free delivery too. It was really well packaged with some background information about where the wood came from, explaining it's unique origin and care guide.\r\nThanks again, Ruthüôè","order_id":3659104608},{"reviewer":"Ria","date_reviewed":"02/13/2025","star_rating":5,"message":"Wow, what a beautiful one of a kind piece of wood/gonk.
