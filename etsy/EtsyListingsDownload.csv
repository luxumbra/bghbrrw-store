Created from a selection of sustainably sourced logs—hazel, cherry, field maple, oak, alder, beech, and ash—each slice has been individually cut and arranged to form a stunning heart design, mounted on a reclaimed wood backboard for a truly eco-friendly decor piece.

Perfect for those who love rustic wall art, wooden wall decor, and nature-inspired interiors, this unique piece makes a wonderful Mother’s Day gift, cottagecore decoration, or sustainable gift for someone special.

🌳 Reclaimed Wood with a Story
This reclaimed wood art carries decades of history. The backboard is made from a 30-year-old garden gate, itself crafted from reclaimed timber that was already 5–10 years old when first used. This means the wood could be 40+ years old, adding rich character, texture, and depth to the piece.

🧙‍♂️ Gonk Folklore – Guardians of Home & Hearth
Rooted in Scandinavian and Nordic folklore, gonks are believed to bring good luck to families and protect homes from misfortune. Often compared to gnomes or tomte, these small, bearded figures sneak into homes to stay warm in winter but retreat to the woodlands when the weather turns mild. Treat them well, and they bring fortune—mistreat them, and expect a little mischief!

Whether you believe in their magical origins or simply love their cosy charm, this wood slice wall art featuring a gonk pyrography design brings both whimsy and tradition into your home.

"Wooden Wall Art wood decor featuring Pyrography Detail and Heart Design, Rustic Wall Art, Wood Decor, Mother's Day Gift","Add warmth, charm, and a touch of folklore to your home with this handcrafted rustic wood heart, featuring a pyrography gonk holding a heart, symbolising love, protection, and folklore tradition. Made from sustainably sourced wood slices. Lovingly made from a selection of reclaimed wood slices—hazel, cherry, oak, alder, beech, field maple, and ash—this eco-friendly wall art is arranged into a heart shape and mounted on a reclaimed wood backboard. Warm white fairy lights add a gentle glow, making it a perfect Mother’s Day gift, cottagecore decor, or a sustainable gift for any nature lover.

🌳 Reclaimed Wood with a Story
This reclaimed wood art carries decades of history. The backboard is made from a 30-year-old garden gate, itself crafted from reclaimed timber that was already 5–10 years old when first used. This means the wood could be 40+ years old, adding rich character, texture, and depth to the piece.

🧙‍♂️ Gonk Folklore – Guardians of Home & Hearth
Rooted in Scandinavian and Nordic folklore, gonks are believed to bring good luck to families and protect homes from misfortune. Often compared to gnomes or tomte, these small, bearded figures sneak into homes to stay warm in winter but retreat to the woodlands when the weather turns mild. Treat them well, and they bring fortune—mistreat them, and expect a little mischief!

Whether you believe in their magical origins or simply love their cosy charm, this wood slice wall art featuring a gonk pyrography design brings both whimsy and tradition into your home.

🎁 A Perfect Gift For:
✔ Mother’s Day – A heartfelt present for mums who love rustic decor 🌸
✔ Cottagecore & Nature Lovers – A perfect eco wall art addition 🏡
✔ Rustic & Wooden Wall Decor Enthusiasts – A handcrafted touch for any home 🪵
✔ Sustainable Gift Seekers – Handmade with locally sourced & reclaimed materials 🌍

📏 Dimensions: Approx. 30.5cm x 27cm
💡 Features: Battery-powered fairy lights (warm white), pyrography detailing, and a unique hand-crafted design.
🔗 Hanging: Brass screw eyes and picture wire for easy wall mounting.
🔋 Power: Small battery pack (hidden on the back) with a simple on/off switch.

"Rustic Wood Slice Wall Art | Handmade Log Wall Art | Kintsugi Inspired Wall Art | Eco-Friendly Decor with Fairy Lights | Bough & Burrow","Handmade with care in the Cotswolds, this one-of-a-kind wall piece from The Burrow blends nature, history, and light.

Crafted from locally salvaged hazel, willow, hawthorn, and sycamore slices, the tree mosaic is set on a reclaimed timber backboard—once part of a garden gate built over 30 years ago from old pallet wood. A prominent crack in the timber has been lovingly repaired using 1.3mm copper wire stitches, inspired by the Japanese philosophy of kintsugi—highlighting the beauty of flaws and restoration. At the base of the tree, river stones from the Tintagel area and moss from The Cotswolds ground the piece, taking inspiration from the landscapes of Dartmoor and the Quantock Hills. 

Woven into the canopy are warm white remote-control fairy lights, creating a magical glow that brings the piece to life, day or night. Finished in natural beeswax to enhance the wood's character and offer lasting protection.

This piece is fitted with brass hardware on the back and is ready to hang. The Bough & Burrow logo is fire branded discretely on the reverse.

"Rustic Tealight Holder | Wooden Centrepiece |  Rustic Earthy Decor by Bough & Burrow","This unique tealight holder is made from a naturally forked branch, its shape carefully followed and preserved to honour the tree’s original growth. The bark and moss has been left intact in places and stripped in others and is finished with beeswax to protect the wood & natural moss. 

During its life as a log in the woods, it has developed a beautiful spalting and patina that is brought out by the natural beeswax finish. The light from the tealights plays beautifully over the grain of this piece.

The log is hazel and was gathered locally. Four recessed tealight wells flow with the shape of the gently sculpted wood, making this piece feel both intentional and organic — equally at home on a rustic dining table, a nature altar, or a quiet windowsill.

"Rustic Wood Slice Wall Art | Log Wall Art, Handmade from Reclaimed Timber | Eco-Friendly Decor with Fairy Lights | Bough & Burrow","A piece of the woodland, brought home.

This handcrafted mosaic tree is made from slices of locally gathered hawthorn, spalted hazel, willow, and other found timbers.

Woven with soft copper fairy lights and finished with beeswax, the tree gently glows at night — a calming, grounded presence for any space. Whether it's hung in a hallway, reading nook, or woodland-inspired nursery, this artwork invites a little stillness and wonder.

"Storm-Fallen Oak 4 Tealight Holder | Reclaimed Natural Wood Candle Stand | Rustic Bark Centrepiece | Handmade by Bough & Burrow","This rugged yet refined tealight holder is shaped from a naturally contoured slab of oak, left with its full bark edge to honour the untamed lines of the tree it came from. Four carefully carved hollows cradle tealights in a gentle arc, following the natural form of the wood.

Where the bark was fragile or beginning to lift, it’s been gently reinforced with handmade copper staples — a nod to traditional timber repair and inspired by the Japanese philosophy of kintsugi. Rather than disguising imperfections, these copper stitches celebrate them — marking each piece’s history with care and intention. This approach echoes the principles of wabi-sabi: embracing the beauty in the weathered, the asymmetrical, and the naturally aged.

Each piece includes tealights and ships free via Tracked 48 in plastic-free, recycled packaging — ready to gift or light the moment it arrives.

Features:
- Made from sustainably sourced oak with natural bark edge
- Four tealight hollows (4 x Tealights included)
- Reinforced with handmade copper staples
- Finished with natural beeswax for a subtle sheen
